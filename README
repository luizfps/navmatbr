ChromeVox is a Chrome extension that turns Chrome into a self-voicing browser.
It runs on ChromeOs, Chrome and Android (as AndroidVox).

BUILDING:

The rhino Javascript intepreter and the Google closure compiler are required.
Please update the top of Makefile with their paths.

The Closure libraries don't have a good packaging system.  The easiest way to
get the required tools is to download them from code.google.com and
move them to /usr/local/lib/closure.  The directory should have the following
files:

compiler.jar
closurebuilder.py
depstree.py
depswriter.py
jscompiler.py
source.py
treescan.py

To build AndroidVox, run 'make androidVoxDev.js'
To build ClankVox, run 'make clankVoxDev.js'

RUNNING:



Running in WebViews on Android:
1. Checkout the Android source.

2. Where you checked out the code, run this command to set the URL that WebViews
will use for injecting ChromeVox:
./vendor/google/tools/override-gservices secure:accessibility_script_injection_url=https://myserver.com/myBuildOfChromeVox.js

3. To reset back to the default, use this command:
./vendor/google/tools/override-gservices reset secure:accessibility_script_injection_url




Running as a whitelisted extension:
Whitelisted extensions can run in other extensions, in the chrome of Chrome,
etc. This is the way that ChromeVox runs in ChromeOS. To try out this as a
developer, add the following line to the manifest:
"key": "MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQDEGBi/oD7Yl/Y16w3+gee/95/EUpRZ2U6c+8orV5ei+3CRsBsoXI/DPGBauZ3rWQ47aQnfoG00sXigFdJA2NhNK9OgmRA2evnsRRbjYm2BG1twpaLsgQPPus3PyczbDCvhFu8k24wzFyEtxLrfxAGBseBPb9QrCz7B4k2QgxD/CwIDAQAB",
